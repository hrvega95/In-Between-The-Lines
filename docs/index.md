The goal of this project is to have an agent play in a game of Line Runner via Minecraft. The agent is set to learn to play through computer vision. Specifically, the agent will be able to visually compute what actions to make given what it can see as it is running forward on the map. The agent will be tested through various levels of difficulty.
